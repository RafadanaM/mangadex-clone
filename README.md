This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Things I learned

- There are still a lot of things that I can still learn about layout
- Grid is extremely powerful
- I need to use less FlexBox and choose Grid instead
- I need to learn more about theming and creating components with theme
